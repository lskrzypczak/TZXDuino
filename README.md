## TZXDuino

Even though this repo is a fork of the hugely out of date github repo (see https://github.com/sadken/TZXDuino), it contains the latest source from https://www.facebook.com/Arduitape

For now, the master branch is identical to upstream Arduitape TZXDuino source up to version 1.19 - apart from one small difference - which is that I don't change the filenames for each new version.  I figured that GitHub tags + releases achieve that already in a better and more scalable way.

I have been contributing my own enhancements on top of 1.19 (some of which are already in master branch).  I might have other branches in-progress or in flux over time, with the intention to contribute as much as possible to master branch (to the extent it makes sense to do so).

I'll try to keep this up-to-date and would like to encourage other developers to fork/contribute to this repo, so that there's always one up-to-date standard codebase available, even if it is not quite yet the 'official' TZXDuino repo.
